Introduces the project and context and makes recommendations for suitable project approach/s. 


Agile SCRUM


Product: Share portfolio management software. First released in 2004. Current version 6.4. 


Organisation: Used exclusively in NZ by 11 small to medium sized companies that belong to a single Investment Management franchise. 


Background: Stability, usability and support of current platforms by the software have become an issue for the franchisees. This triggered a search for a replacement product. The result of that extensive project was a decision to redevelop and extend the existing product because it was relatively unique in the market. The franchise group believes that this product differentiates their business but also has potential as a product for on-selling if it is redeveloped effectively. The existing software has a large body of code which has decayed over time. There is a team of 3 people currently that maintain and support the software. The software does not currently support mobile platforms. The Franchise group has confirmed feasibility for this redevelopment and, following a failure to interest software development companies has decided on an in-house development team for the new product. They envisage that this team will be attached to the franchise headquarters in Albany and will start with 12 new members (in additional to existing team) and increase to around 18 by the end of 2017.




All recommendations are supported with clear rationale that reference both project attributes and software engineering literature where relevant. The report should also link to the ‘Project Practice Guide’ and the ‘Project Tool Guide’ (see below) for specific details related to implementing practices or tools. 


Recommendations explained referencing 


Project attributes
Redeveloping and extend existing product > agile methodology of incremental implementation
Existing software has a large body of code which decayed over time > communication between team members will be substantially more important to notify who is working on which part
Team of 3 people that maintain and support the software with 12 new member when they merge and increase to around 18 > more emphasis on communication and collaboration, need development processes documented so that new members can quickly catch up to the existing team 
Software does not currently support mobile platforms > new UI design (bootstrap?)/ functionalities may cause errors when imported to a mobile device, they need to plan out how their product will look/ function in the early stages of development

Executive Summary 


A single presentation slide that provides a summary of both your project and context and of the recommendations you are making and why. The goal is to convey your results clearly to a set of intelligent but busy people.
