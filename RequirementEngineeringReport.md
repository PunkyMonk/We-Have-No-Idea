Requirements Engineering 


The project outline entails that it is“redeveloping and extend existing product” which fits the incremental implementation of Agile methodology. It is important for the Product Owner to develop and maintain a well ordered product backlog all the way throughout the project that capture and update the client requirements. Backlogs are dynamic and evolves as the product requirements to fit the idea of what is appropriate, competitive and useful at that particular time. These backlog form a basis for time boxing sprints and prevents scope creep.


During the project it is expected that the project team use the existing software’s large body of code which decayed over time. Analysing the existing systems would be advisable so that they can find out if there are better alternatives for things in place. It may be required that product owner conduct a series of client meetings to elicit new requirement that take new technologies into account and eliminate some outdated and irrelevant requirements
