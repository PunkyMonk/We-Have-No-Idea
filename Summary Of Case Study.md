Case Study 2
============

Product: Portfolio Management Software

-   Code that has decayed over time since 2004

-   Current team of 3 to maintain and support software

-   No support for mobile devices

 

Summary
-------

Current state of software’s stability, usability and support in current modern
platforms has become an issue for the organizations that are using the software.  
  
They tried to search for a replacement, but decided to just extend and redevelop
the current project, as they thought that the software was unique compared to
other competing software in the same market.

 

Owner of software believes that product is what make them unique to other
competitors, and if redeveloped well, could potentially be sold to other buyers.  
  
Because of no interest from software development companies to redevelop and
extend the current software, they have decided to use an in-house development
team. The team will consist of 12 new members added onto the current team of 3,
and expect to increase to 18 by late 2017.
