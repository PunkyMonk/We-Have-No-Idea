# **Learning Package - SCRUM board**

###### **Estimated time for this learning package:** TODO

This learning package is to help the Share portfolio management software team utilise a SCRUM board into their daily development process. The learning package will aim at giving the 12 members of the development team enough knowledge and practise in order for them to be competent in using a SCRUM board every day as part of the project approach using SCRUM methodologies. The learning package will also aim to give any additional team members joining the development team enough knowledge and practise to be competent and as experienced as the rest of the team.**

## **Target Audience**

**This learning package is aimed at all members of the project that are participating in any activity related to the development of the Shareportfolio management software. Because the project methodology is SCRUM, the project team will comprise of developers, testers, and project managers.**

**The Share portfolio management team will comprise of 12 members at the start of development and expand to around 18 members by the end of 2017, therefore upscaling will be split into two phases:**

<br/>

* **Phase 1:** Upscaling of the initial 12 team members and project managers who will be starting development.
<br/>
* **Phase 2:** Upscaling the additional team members and project managers who will join the development team in future.

<br/>
##### Because of this, the SCRUM board learning package was developed to accomodate any new members being able to upscale at any time.
<br/>


# **Learning Plan**

SCRUM boards are a vital tool to every software project using the agile-SCRUM approach. A SCRUM board is a tool that allows teams to visualise and abstract Sprint Backlog items by visualising them in a physical manner virtually using cards. The purpose of a SCRUM board is show all work items that need to be completed during a current sprint. The SCRUM board is a visual way to assign work tasks from the sprint backlog while tracking and evaluating a sprint's progress.

## **Learning Goals**

### *By the end of this Learning Package you should be able to:*

1. *Identify all relevant aspects of a SCRUM board*
<br/>

2. *Identify all roles involved with using a SCRUM board*
<br/>

3. *Participate in a standup involving using a SCRUM board*
<br/>

4. *Conduct as standup as a SCRUM master using a SCRUM board*
<br/>

## Learn and identify all relevent aspects of a SCRUM board
#### Time: *5min approx*

A scrum board comprises of various columns and rows. Each column represents the state of a card or task. A card contains a task related to a user story from the sprint backlog on the scrum board. Each row of the scrum board is a user story. 

The general columns of a scrum board are:
* Story: User stories from the current sprint backlog are placed here for each row of the Scrum board.
* To Do: All task cards that have not been assigned, or do not belong in the other columns are put here.
* Doing: All cards currently assigned to members for work are put here.
* Done: All cards that represent tasks that have been completed are put here.

Additional columns can be used but these depend on the nature of the project. As such, these could be columns such as 'Notes', 'Issues' or 'Tests'.

## Learn and identify all roles involved with using a SCRUM board
#### Time: *5min approx*


There are two roles used when using a SCRUM board:
* Scrum master: Responsible for conducting daily standup and writing/assigning cards to SCRUM board.
* Development team member: A member of the team participating in the standup. 

The Scrum master is tasked with leading the standup and directly interacts with the SCRUM board. It is their job to assure that the SCRUM board is properly maintained and reflects the current state of the sprint. 

The development team members are all other team members participating in a standup and while do not interact with the SCRUM board directly, they collaborate with the SCRUM master to determine the state of cards both new and old, with respect to their place on the SCRUM board.

## Test team member's knowledge with scrum board quiz
#### Time: *10min approx*

Each member should complete [this revision test](scrum-board-quiz.md) and aim to score 100% before continuing.
The answers can be found under the learning resources section.




### *Participate in a standup*
#### Time: *15min*

#### Actions:
1. Setup a SCRUM board in the work environment of the development team.
2. Select a couple of user stories from the product backlog of the project.
3. Using the user stories from step 2., conduct a mock SCRUM standup. Be sure to assign tasks to each member of the team. Because of the size of the team, more user stories may need to be added.

## Learning activity

### *Conduct a standup as SCRUM master*

#### Goal

In order to reinforce the ideas and processes surrounding a Scrum task board it is important that each team member have a go at being the scrum master for a standup session in order to show that they understand how a scrum board works.

#### Time: *15min per team member*

#### Actions:
1. Select a couple of different user stories from the previous learning plan objective.
2. Select a new Scrum master and conduct another SCRUM standup like the previous learning plan objective.
3. Repeat this process for all members until each member is proficient with the process of standups and how to use a SCRUM task board.
