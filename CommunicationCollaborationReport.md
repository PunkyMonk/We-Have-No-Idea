Agile methodology emphasises the importance of adaptability to account for the dynamic and competitive nature of the modern software development. In such an environment it is crucial that teams, team members and client keep communicating throughout the duration of the project to successfully plan out and collaborate the work.
For our case study there are several different areas of the project that will be affected by the Agile SCRUM practices we have researched.




Communication and Collaboration


Currently there are 3 people that maintain and support the software but once they launch the development project they envisage the the team will be attached their franchise headquarters, with 12 new members (15 total) and increase to 18 by the end of 2017. 


If we look at how Scrum teams are designed, they have defined roles consisting of product owner, scrum master and the development team. Scrum teams are designed to be “self- organizing and cross functional” which means, in theory, that they have the capacity to get any work done without depending on others not part of the team (The Scrum Guide, 2016).


Product Owner
Communicates with the client and is responsible for eliciting requirements to form the product backlog 


Scrum Master
Responsible for facilitating the team progress and ensure that the team adheres to the practices and rules.


Development Team
        Deliver incremental versions of the product that are functional at the end of each sprint.
Assigning specific roles to team members is highly recommended as it will ensure that each development team members have a person to refer to when they are unsure of a requirement to implement or having issues collaborating with another member. 


Optimal development team size is between 3 to 9, small enough to be nimble while being big enough to complete large workloads within a sprint. Less than 3 members may mean that the team decrease in interaction or do not contain enough people with specialized skill sets which could result in smaller productivity gains. More than 9 members however, requires much coordination between members and are regarded too complex for an empirical process like SCRUM to handle. (The SCRUM guide, 2016) For our project based on these finding we would recommend that they form teams of 7 and 8 while in a team of 15, to a 9 member teams when they increase their project team to 18 members.


Practices like client sprint planning, stand up and showcase (shown in the project practice guide) are included in a sprint which generally runs for a week to less than a month. It will help the team to maintain effective communication between the team members and with client




Sprint planning
By planning a well time-boxed sprints that evenly distribute workload to each project member, they can ensure a steady progress and an effective collaboration of work        


Daily Scrum
Allows for synchronizing activities by creating a plan that accounts for work done since the last scrum and forecast a realistic work that can be done before the next meeting. Identifying potential issues and monitoring progress of others is important in eliminating impediments in development.


Sprint Review
Based on sprint goals the increment completed in the sprint is showcased to elicit feedbacks and encourage future collaboration. Discussion on what should be done next is invaluable as those input can be put into the subsequent sprint plan.


Incremental deliveries of “Done” products are produced every sprint which means that they will always have a working version available at any stage of development. This leads to our next point:
