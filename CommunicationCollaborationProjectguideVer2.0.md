Communication & Collaboration Project guide


Agile methodology emphasises the importance of adaptability due to the dynamic and competitive nature of the modern software development, and in such an environment it is crucial that teams and team members keep communicating throughout the duration of the project to successfully collaborate the divided workload.


According to research from Agile modeling (n.d.) the most effective communication is face- to- face that are enhanced by a medium like a white board.
 
While communicating they should strive to utilise communication techniques that are applicable to their situation (e.g. if members are missing face to face conversation with notes may be more efficient), change your approach throughout the project to fit the situation.


Controlling the factors that may affect communication may also be a good practice.
Physical proximity
When people are closer together they have a greater chance for communicating
 
Temporal proximity
Whether people are working at the same time can also interrupt the workflow
 
Amicability
People’s willingness to hear and accept that thoughts given by another person


They can take into account the above premises so that they can communicate and collaborate their work more effective for sprint planning, daily scrum and sprint review.


Sprint Planning 
A document that describes the highest priority features at the beginning of a sprint to define two artifacts: Sprint goal and Sprint backlog
Sprint goal is short description of the what is expected to be produced for the increment while sprint backlog is a list of product backlog items that outline necessary tasks needed in delivering those items.


Daily Scrum
Meetings are held at the beginning of each sprint day to identify what have been done on the previous day, what will be done on that day and issues that they faced which may impede their progress


Sprint Review
Showcase what they have completed (bug-free, functional version of the software) during the sprint and assess the project against the sprint goals produced in the sprint planning to see if they have achieved the overall goals. Product backlogs brought in and checked against the functionality, feedbacks are elicited based on whether backlog items are done to an acceptable standard and new items are formed based on feedbacks and incomplete items.
