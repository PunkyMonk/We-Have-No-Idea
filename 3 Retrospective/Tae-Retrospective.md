# Retrospective: Tae Park

##What I've done well

1. Established and maintained communication within the team. I was able to consistently maintain our mode of communication of Facebook active, so that we could share our thoughts and work together effectively. 

2. Mediated conflicts within the team. As team leader, I was able to mediate conflicts between members with differing opinions. For example, there was a situation where the team was split on a decision. I listened to both sides and solved the conflict by being fait to all members. 

##What I could improve on

1. Something I could improve on would be following the project "Release Plan" I had created for Milestone 1. I was very lazy as the team's leader to organize the team so that the work could go according to the "Release Plan". Next time, for a similar project, I think creating a release plan that takes into account the assignments and work of other papers for each group member, would help manage the team better.

2. Finding a different mode of communication other than Facebook would be something I would like to improve on. Because Facebook is not only a chat platform, it contains other distracting elements, such as other friends, which causes members of the team to procrastinate more often, therefore delaying our progress. Next time, finding a different chatting platform we can do online, (e.g. Skype) wou;d be beneficial in me being able to manage deadlines for the team better.

##What I've learned so far

1. From this process I have learned how github funtions and how it is used as a repository for writing a report. For example github can be used to do Version Control, which is very useful when multiple users need to access documents. It also is able to track if contributors have been contributing to the repository and if each member has been doing a fair amount of work.

2. From this project I have learned the importance of peer reviews. Peer reviewing has been a vital part of our project as, sometimes when writing documents, members may miss information which goes undetected by the writer. Peer reviewing esstentially ensures our work/documents are up to everyone's standards.
