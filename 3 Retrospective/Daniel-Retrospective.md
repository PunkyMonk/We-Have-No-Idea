# Retrospective: Daniel Oram


##Two things you did well.

- Peer reviewing work items
This was a very fun part for me. It felt really satisfying reviewing the other member's work and suggesting changes. I think this was because it improved our communication and that we were achieving our goals. 

- Communication throughout the project
I felt there were really strong communication channels between me and the rest of the team. We got along well and generally it felt like the perfect project team (when we were performing) from a communications perspective.

- (special mention) Learning package
I have to mention this because I really enjoyed making the learning package and I do think I did a really good job. I was quite proud of this part.

##Two things you could improve. How?

- The quality of the project tool guide for the parts I contributed
I got quite bored with this aspect and felt continuously burnt out as a result. I feel the quality of the sections of the practices/tool guides that I contributed suffered a little as a result.

- Estimating my work efficiency when promising work (Big Improvements could be made here)
This was my biggest issue, especially during the first half of the group project. I would promise more than I could deliver which ended up with me earning a reputation of being a slacker and causing a little stress on another member.. I picked up my efforts considerably during the second half of the project but it affected the level of trust I had with my team which could have been costly if the issue persisted. 

##Two things you have learned during this project.

- How to merge branches on github!
I have always had huge issues understanding and performing pull requests and merges using git!! I feel like a master of git and GitHub now! Such a useful skill and wonderful feeling for me personally.

- How to use markdown and styles on github
I had never thought to create flashy markdown files before but now I am addicted to it. I want to utilise this skill and try reach out to opensource projects on github and offer to do documentation for them..


- (Special mention) To not promise more than I can deliver
Re-iterating from my last point in the things to improve.. My new motto is "under-promise over-deliver" and this sums up this point perfectly. I learnt the importance of promising work in a project and its relationship to trust and communication in an agile environment!
