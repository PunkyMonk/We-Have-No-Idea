# Retrospective: Daniel Oram

Individual reflection is also important for learning. Identify:

##Two things you did well.

- Peer reviewing work items
This was a very fun part for me. It felt really satisfying reviewing the other member's work and suggesting changes. I think this was because it improved our communication and that we were achieving our goals. 

- Communication throughout the project
I felt there were really strong communication channels between me and the rest of the team. We got along well and generally it felt like the perfect project team (when we were performing) from a communications perspective.

- (special mention) Learning package
I have to mention this because I really enjoyed making the learning package and I do think I did a really good job. I was quite proud of this part.

##Two things you could improve. How?

- The quality of the project tool guide for the parts I contributed
I got quite bored with this aspect and felt continuously burnt out as a result. I feel the quality of the sections of the practices/tool guides that I contributed suffered a little as a result.

- Estimating my work efficiency when promising work (Big Improvements could be made here)
This was my biggest issue, especially during the first half of the group project. I would promise more than I could deliver which ended up with me earning a reputation of being a slacker and causing a little stress on another member.. I picked up my efforts considerably during the second half of the project but it affected the level of trust I had with my team which could have been costly if the issue persisted. 

##Two things you have learned during this project.

- How to merge branches on github!
I have always had huge issues understanding and performing pull requests and merges using git!! I feel like a master of git and GitHub now! Such a useful skill and wonderful feeling for me personally.

- How to use markdown and styles on github
I had never thought to create flashy markdown files before but now I am addicted to it. I want to utilise this skill and try reach out to opensource projects on github and offer to do documentation for them..


- (Special mention) To not promise more than I can deliver
Re-iterating from my last point in the things to improve.. My new motto is "under-promise over-deliver" and this sums up this point perfectly. I learnt the importance of promising work in a project and its relationship to trust and communication in an agile environment!







## Collaboration

I personally felt that everyone was actively involved in discussion during the duration of the project. There were times when things got very quiet, especially during the break. But I don't believe there was any issues with miscommunication.

## Planning and tracking 

I feel planning and tracking could be improved if we were ever to do this assignment again. Most of the work was completed during the last two weeks of the assignment. Although the deliverables progressed steadily, development was a bit of a rush at the end. I feel we made good use of Agile methodologies using Trello and github to track and document our progress but that we did not stick to our release plan very well. 

Personally I had not used github and trello extensively before the assignment and I learnt a fantastic amount about features of both that I will be able to use on future software projects. I have learnt a lot about markdown styling on github and how to perform pull requests and merge branches. These things have always been a problem for me in the past with other projects and this personally was the greatest thing I will take away from this project.

## version control

Version control was, in my opinion, a very well managed and maintained aspect of our project. Github allowed us to clearly see the changes and contributions of each member that uploaded their work to github. I felt this was satisfactory for our group's work.

## Quality assurance

The best quality assurance practice we used was definitely the peer reviews. Once someone completed a work item, the card was moved to the peer review list of Trello and the team notified to review the work of the member. This led to some really constructive feedback and changes which I think really helped improve the quality of the content of the wiki.
