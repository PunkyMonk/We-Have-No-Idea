# Retrospective: Jung Wook Lee


Two things you did well

1. Communicating with the team
I felt that as a group we communicated very well. There was never any issues or conflicts within the team. 

2. Provoking constructive discussion
I feel I participated in a lot of constructive discussions. During meetings I really felt like I was valuable to the project. This was a success for me.

Two things you could improve and How?

1. Time management
I was lacking with managing to produce the files I was tasked with within the time frame I was given. I think we all got a little too caught up with other assignments and uni that we neglected this project for a long time.

2. Attend more standups
As a team we probably needed more standups to facilitate getting more work done and to our release plan.


Two things you have learned during this project

1. The importance of establishing responsibility 
It is important to establish the roles and responsibilities of each member. We all participated in doing everything but I feel we should have had specialised roles.

2. The importance of version control
I haven't used github much before but now I know how much of a great tool it is for version control. I thought it was really cool how you could see all the additions and changes that members had made to each file.
