# Team retrospective

##### As a group, our team got together and held a team project retrospective using Trello to record each individual team members response to the following questions.

##### - Using Github for version control

#####- Using Standup meetings
We would use standups again because they emphasised the most important practice in any project, which is communication. Our standups really helped with keeping the project afloat, even when they were not productive. It kept us aware of the project status, even when things got quite during the mid-semester break.
