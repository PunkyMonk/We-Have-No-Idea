# Team retrospective

### As a group, our team got together and held a team project retrospective using Trello to record each individual team members response to the following questions.

## Practices/processes that you would use again & why

##### - Using a SCRUM board to facilitate agile development
Using Trello helped facilitate effective communication and decision making within the team. Because there was a lot of difficulty at times trying to organise meetings, Trello worked well as a virtual SCRUM board for this reason.

##### - Using Github for version control
We would use Github again as a tool for version control. It was really easy for each member to work on the same or separate documents at the same time and be able to review the contributions and changes by each member.

#####- Using Standup meetings
We would use standups again because they emphasised the most important practice in any project, which is communication. Our standups really helped with keeping the project afloat, even when they were not productive. It kept us aware of the project status, even when things got quite during the mid-semester break.

##### - Having showcases and other Quality Assurance practices
Having showcases alongside the standup meetings allowed us to see each members progress and evaluate their work rate. This is something that we would use again because it was important to our quality assurance. Having these showcases also acted as a way to test our deliverables. Because the deliverable is a wiki; the design, flow, grammar and project requirements were the testing criteria.

## Practices/processes that you would drop & why

##### - Using facebook as the primary tool for discussion
We used facebook as a forum for general discussion during our development of the wiki. This proved to be the most effective way to get in touch with any team member as it was almost guaranteed that a member would read the messages posted within an hour at worst.

The drawback with using facebook was that it was too much of a social media outlet and thus conversations would digress into general conversation that was not related to the project. This degraded the quality of conversations as well as the overall professionalism of communication amongst all team members.

##### - Not following the release plan strictly
We did not adhere to the sprint plan that well. We felt it was one of our biggest threats to the project deliverables. Although we followed an agile approach to development we did not utilise the sprint plan with our SCRUM methodologies in an effective manner. If we were to do the project again it would be completed by more strictly adhering to the release plan set out in the first part.

##### - Using a wiki to convey the recommendations to the client
There were some members who felt that if the project were to be done again, that the use of a wiki for sharing the project deliverables with the client be dropped. Those same members felt that a different media be used to show the deliverables to the client. At the very least, that using Markdown (.md) files on github be sufficient.

##### - Using Github for version control
Some members felt that github was exessive and unecessary as it required upscaling to use correctly and caused fustration that could have been mitigated had a simpler tool for version control been used.

## Practices/processes that you would add if you had to do a similar project again & why

##### - Using a tool like Skype to communicate verbally when we couldn't meet up in person
Our team felt that we suffered from not being able to meet up as often as we had originally planned due to conflicts on interest and university. We all agree that the use of a verbal communications tool like skype would have allowed us to hold virtual meetings and resolved this issue had we used it.

##### - Enforce deadlines
It was agreed by all that the deadlines were not strictly adhered to at many times. There were strong feelings that we normalised too much as a group and were passive in our approach to this issue.

##### - Make smaller sprint plans and utilise planning poker
We felt our sprint plans were too big and that the sprint backlogs of each should be broken down into smaller pieces in the future for similar projects. We attribute this to us not knowing what each individual's work output and efficiency being as we had not worked together before. 

For this reason we should have used planning poker at the start of development of the wiki but we did not as we deemed it not necessary because of the nature of the project itself. This was agreed by all to have been a mistake..

##### - Have more scrum standups
The frequency of our standups increased as the project got closer to the deadline. It was agreed that in a similar project, we use more standups earlier on in the project and maintain the frequency of them from there.


##### - Assign specific roles to each members
We did not assign specific roles to each member which we would do in future. Some members seemed to enjoy and perform certain activities better than in other work they were assigned. Having a dedicated peer reviewer, minute keeper, and document formatting guru would have been more beneficial for us.

#Conclusion

####**In conclusion, as a team we are happy with our deliverables. We admit that we did not adhere purely to our documented Work Breakdown Structure and Release plan but that we utilised many aspects of Agile methodologies when developing the wiki.**

####**We picked what processes and practices we liked from SCRUM instead of adhering to it completely. We believe given the nature of the project to create this wiki, that this was an acceptable approach and embodies the spirit of Agile and SCRUM - Managing change and applying the right processes and tools to achieve functional software**
