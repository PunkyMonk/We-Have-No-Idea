Planning and Tracking
---------------------

For this project we have selected practices to be used for planning and tracking the project
including sprint planning meetings, planning poker, burndown charts, backlogs
and their various tools that can be used. These can be all found in the ‘Project
Practice Guide’ and the ‘Project Tool Guide’ sections.

 

### Sprint Planning Meetings

-   During the redevelopment and extension phase of this project, using Sprint
    Planning meetings at the beginning of sprints will be vital in planning and
    assigning tasks to members. As stated in the practice guide, this meeting is
    for all stakeholders; team members, scrum master and the product owner to
    decide which user stories to undertake in the sprint. In both phases of
    development, planning meetings should be consistently done at the beginning
    of the sprints and all stakeholders should know what is happening by the end
    of the meeting.

-   As the development team is an in-house development team the Tool most
    suitable would be a ‘Physical Scrum board’ as described in the ‘Project Tool
    guide’. This would be a useful tool in supporting planning meetings, as
    everyone present at the meeting would be able to visualize all materials on
    what has been completed and what needs to be done in the form of cards on
    the scrum board. This will help increase communication between all members to effectively make decisions to
    match the state of the scrum board.

### Planning Poker


-   At the start of the redevelopment phase of the project, the requirements of the current software would need to be re-evaluated in     order to decide what is reusable in the redeveloped software.
    The effort for each user story will need to be re-assigned, as the market has changed and the team is
    different. It has been several years since the effort values were
    assigned when first developing the software which won't reflect the redevelopment teams effeciency. So using planning poker, as
    stated in the ‘Project Practice guide’ will allow the team to re-evaluate
    the values and to allow planning of future sprints.

-   For extending the software after redevelopment, new requirements will need
    to be created, so using planning poker to assign the effort values for
    planning future sprints is necessary.

-   Considering the size of the 2 development teams, using an ‘Online planning
    poker’ game is recommended, as a standard poker deck would not work for
    both teams of 7 or 8 members, which is stated in the  ‘Project Tool guide’.

### Burndown Chart

-   For both redeveloping and extending the software, two types
    of burndown charts will be required. These are described in the ‘Project Practice guide’.
    Having two separate overall burndown charts for each phase
    of development will be more efficient in tracking and measuring the amount
    of work completed. This is because sprints will continue on in the second phase and a new burndown chart completed before this starts. 
    The other type of burndown charts are sprint burndown charts.These are used for
    viewing progress in a more detailed view and tracking a single sprints work
    progression plus rate of work.

-   Similar to sprint planning meetings, using a ‘physical scrum board’ is recommended for the Portfolio management software               redevelopment project. This board will be where the burndown chart would be located throughout
    development, so during meetings everyone can visualize the status of the
    current sprint or the current phase.

### Backlog

-   For redevelopment the product backlog, as stated in the ‘Project Practice
    guide’, will need changing to accomodate new requirements to reflect the need for stability and usability of the product.
    It should be noted that many requirements will not change due to the client still wanting the same
    functionality as the current software. Sprint backlogs, as
    stated in the ‘Project Practice guide’ are just user stories from the
    product backlog selected for development into a sprint. 
    Although some changes may occur due to the need to support new platforms, some requirements will be needed to changed before
    development commences. Planning and tracking user stories within backlogs is
    vital in planning ahead, and identifying early problems.

-   For extending the software, the product backlog and the sprint backlog will
    have to additional user stories added throughout development. New
    backlog items may affect redevelopment planning.

-   Using physical or virtual cards, as stated in the project tool guide, attached to a
    scrum board, are the best ways to create a backlog of user stories and work items. Again, having visual and
    physical materials for the team to be exposed to during meetings, will
    adjourn meetings faster and more effectively. File documents can be used aswell although these are not as dynamic as using scrumboards. Using physical or virtual file documents for backlogs is beneficial for documentation of the project so both are highly reccomended tools to use for development of the Portfolio management software tool.
