Planning and Tracking
---------------------

For this project, practices to be used for planning and tracking the project
include sprint planning meetings, planning poker, burndown charts and backlogs
and their various tools that can be used, which can be all found in the ‘Project
Practice Guide’ and the ‘Project Tool Guide’.

 

### Sprint Planning Meetings

-   During the redevelopment and extension phase of this project, using Sprint
    Planning meetings at the beginning of sprints will be vital in planning and
    assigning tasks to members. As stated in the practice guide, this meeting is
    for all stakeholders; team members, scrum master and the product owner to
    decide which user stories to undertake in the sprint. In both phases of
    development, planning meetings should be consistently done at the beginning
    of the sprints and all stakeholders should know what is happening by the end
    of the meeting.

-   As the development team is an in-house development team the Tool most
    suitable would be a ‘Physical Scrum board’ as described in the ‘Project Tool
    guide’. This would be a useful tool in supporting planning meetings, as
    everyone present at the meeting would be able to visualize all materials on
    what has been completed and what needs to be done in the form of cards on
    the scrum board. This will help all members to effectively make decisions to
    match the state of the scrum board.

### Planning Poker

-   At the start of the redevelopment phase of the project, the requirements of
    the current software would sustain and be used for redevelopment. However,
    the effort for each user story will need to be re-assigned, as the team is
    different and it has been several years since the effort values were
    assigned when first developing the software. So using planning poker, as
    stated in the ‘Project Practice guide’ will need to be executed to re-assign
    the values and to allow planning of future sprints.

-   For extending the software after redevelopment, new requirements will need
    to be created, so using planning poker to assign the effort values for
    planning future sprints will be necessary.

-   Considering the size of the 2 development teams, using an ‘Online planning
    poker’ game will be necessary, as a standard poker deck would not work for
    both teams of 7 or 8 members, which is stated in the  ‘Project Tool guide’.

### Burndown Chart

-   For both redeveloping and extending the software, will require only 2 types
    of burndown charts, which are described in the ‘Project Practice guide’.
    Although having a single overall burndown chart for the entire development
    is recommended, having two separate overall burndown charts for each phase
    of development will be more efficient in tracking and measuring the amount
    of work completed. Although sprints continue on in the second phase, having
    separate overall burndown charts will help the individual phase’s tracking
    progress. The other type of burndown chart are sprint burndown charts, for
    viewing progress in a more detailed view for tracking a single sprints work
    progression and rate of work.

-   Similar to sprint planning meetings, using a ‘physical scrum board’. This
    board will be where the burndown chart would be located throughout
    development, so during meetings everyone can visualize the status of the
    current sprint or the current phase.

### Backlog

-   For redevelopment the product backlog, as stated in the ‘Project Practice
    guide’ will not change except for maybe a few changes in effort points, as
    most requirements will not change due to the client still wanting the same
    functionality. Sprint backlogs will act similarly as a sprint backlog, as
    stated in the ‘Project Practice guide’ are just user stories from the
    product backlog fit into a sprint. Although some changes may occur due to
    the nature of coding for current platforms, as opposed to coding for older
    platforms, so some requirements will be needed to change through
    development. The planning and tracking user stories within backlogs will be
    vital in planning ahead, and potential early problems.

-   For extending the software, the product backlog and the sprint backlog will
    have to be made anew and have frequent changes throughout development. New
    backlogs will not affect planning compared to redevelopment planning.

-   The tools of backlogs are traditionally physical materials, attached to a
    scrum board as stated in the ‘Project Tool guide’. Again, having visual and
    physical materials for the team to be exposed to during meetings, will
    adjourn meetings faster and more effectively.
