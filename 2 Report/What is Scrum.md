What is Scrum
=============

Scrum is an agile framework for completing projects that are formalized for
software development projects (reference). Like all other agile software
practices, scrum is an iterative process that are done in several sprints.

Scrum is completed by a* scrum team* of developers, a *scrum master *who acts as
the facilitator for the process and a *product owner* who owns the product.
Requirements and story points are negotiated and gathered by the team and the
product owner, which are then converted into a *product backlog*. This backlog
is split up into multiple workable *sprints backlogs* that are completed in
*sprints*. A sprint traditionally consists of a *sprint planning meeting *at the
start of a sprint to plan out the sprint, a *burndown chart *to track the
progress of the sprint and have *daily meetings *for the team to share with each
other, what was completed the previous day and what needs to be completed for
the current day. At the end of a sprint a *review & retrospective *is completed
with the team and the product owner to gather 3 main pieces of information; what
went well, what didn’t work well, what needs to be completed next sprint and to
show the product owner a shippable product of what was completed during the
sprint. (reference)
