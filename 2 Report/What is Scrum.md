What is Scrum
=============

Scrum is an agile framework for completing projects that are formalized for
software development projects (Mederios, Neto, Passos, Araujo, 2015). Like all
other agile software practices, scrum is an iterative process that is done in
several development phases called *sprints*.

Scrum is completed by a team of developers, called a *scrum development team*; a
*scrum master*, who acts as the facilitator for the process; and a *product
owner*, who owns the product. Requirements are negotiated and gathered by the
team and the product owner, which are then converted into a *product backlog*.
Each work item in the backlog is given story points. These are used to show to
estimated effort that is needed to complete the work. This backlog is then split
up into multiple workable *sprints backlogs* that are completed in *sprints*.

A sprint traditionally consists of a *sprint planning meeting* at the start of a
sprint to plan out the sprint; a *burndown chart*, to track the progress of the
sprint; and *daily meetings*, for the team to share with each other what was
completed the previous day and what needs to be completed for the current day.

At the end of a sprint a *review & retrospective* is completed with the team and
the product owner. The review is used to show the product owner a shippable
product of what was completed during the sprint and the retrospective is used to
gather 3 main pieces of information; what went well, what didn’t work well, and
what needs to be completed next sprint. and (Mederios, Neto, Passos, Araujo,
2015).

Benefits of Scrum
-----------------

-   Daily Stand-Up Meetings help team stay focused and improve communication -
    Daily Stand-Up meetings allow team members to evaluate their current
    workload in a project. The Scrum master collaborates with each member to
    assess the current state of a work item into 3 key categories; what was
    accomplished yesterday, what will be accomplished today, and what needs to
    be accomplished in the future. This is where the Scrum master gets a chance
    to find out any issues with the project or team. (2016)

-   Use of Quality Assurance practices - Quality assurance practices are used to
    ensure that proper testing of the product is completed in order to determine
    that the product is functioning correctly. These tests and practices are
    traditionally carried out at the end of each sprint as part of the review
    process, but can be done any time during development to get an idea of
    potential problems with the state of the current project. (2016)

-   Easy Feedback and Changes - Feedback is received regularly throughout
    development through the use of daily stand-up meetings, sprint reviews and
    retrospectives. The major benefit is that managing changes can be done
    before changes become too large. Problems can be detected faster, which
    gives a chance for the development team to be dedicate some time to problems
    to prevent them. (2016)

-   Tracking work done - Through the use of burndown charts used for the entire
    development process and for individual sprints, progress of work completed
    can be tracked and compared to the planned rate of work completed. This is
    an effective way of measuring and tracking the team’s current speed of
    progress, so as to have development step it up accordingly. (2016)

 

Disadvantages of Scrum
----------------------

-   Daily scrum meetings and reviews consume substantial resources - Throughout
    meetings and reviews requires consistent dedication from all members
    involved and consistent high-levels of communication. This will cause
    members to become stressed and produce unsatisfactory work. (Uhlid, n.d)

-   Scrum can be difficult if the project lacks planning and definition - The
    more unclear a project is, the more difficult the task of planning can be
    for the scrum master. This will result in a difficult development process
    for the entire team, which will produce unsatisfactory work. (Uhlid, n.d)

-   Slacking Team Members Cause Inefficiency - If a member(s) falls behind in
    the work rate, this may impact the team’s efficiency and management of the
    project. Especially if sprints are backed-up due to lack of work can
    severely damage project tasks. (2016)
