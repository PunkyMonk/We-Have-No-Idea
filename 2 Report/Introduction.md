Introduction
============

The client’s system, which was released in 2004 is a relatively unique “Share
Portfolio Management” software in the market. The software currently is in need
of redevelopment because of its lack of stability, usability and support on
modern platforms and plans for extending the system have been suggested.

The aim of this project is to recommend a suitable approach along with practices
and tools for the redevelopment and extension of the client’s software, so that
it is stable, usable and supported for modern platforms.

This report presents the scrum approach for the client, which includes how scrum
will be the most suitable approach for the client by comparing other approaches.

A description of scrum’s collaboration & communication, requirements
engineering, project planning & tracking, managing change and quality assurance
will be described by, frequently referencing the project practice guide and the
project tool guide produced by our team.
