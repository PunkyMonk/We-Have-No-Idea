Managing Change
---------------

For this project, the practices to be used in managing change in are; daily
meetings, sprint planning meetings and backlogs, which can all be found in the
‘Project Tool guide’ and the ‘Project practice guide’.

### Daily Meetings

-   Daily meetings as found in the ‘Project Practice Guide’ during the
    redevelopment process are opportunities for team members to present changes
    that could happen because of new code. The meetings would be quick meetings,
    where anyone with any impending changes due to code or any changes for the
    requirements can present them during meetings, and have them discussed.
    After discussion either, continue working or put it into the backlog for
    future sprints.

-   For the extension process of the the project, daily meetings will be vital
    in managing frequently changing requirements. During these daily meetings, a
    discussion of the change would be executed and also inserted into the
    backlog.

-   Tools for daily meetings would be a localized location for meetings where
    all stakeholders have access to. Stand-up daily meetings would facilitate
    face-to-face communication, so that ideas and discussions are done
    thoroughly and no details are missed.

### Product Backlog

-   For both the phases of this development, the use of the product backlog to
    record all large changes as user stories is an effective way of handling
    change as found in the ‘Project Practice Guide’. As daily meetings are
    completed, changes that are significant enough to insert new user stories or
    have them edited, would have the changes brought up in Sprint Planning
    Meetings at the beginning of a sprint.

-   A tool that could be used for managing change with a product backlog would
    be an online repository that would store the backlog and have it updated in
    real-time. This will allow the team to view the backlog from their
    workstation, and if anyone had a change that was not described in the
    product backlog, they could note it down for the next meeting.
