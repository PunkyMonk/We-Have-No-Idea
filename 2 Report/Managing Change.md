Managing Change
---------------

For this project, the reccomended practices used in managing change are; daily
meetings and backlogs, which can all be found in the
‘Project Tool guide’ and the ‘Project practice guide’.

### Daily Meetings

-   Daily meetings for this project are opportunities for team members to present changes
    that could happen to the Portfolio management software because of new code. The meetings would be quick,
    where anyone with any impending changes due to code or any changes for the
    requirements can present and have them discussed.
    After discussion, it can be addressed in the current sprint or put into the backlog for
    future sprints.

-   Tools for daily meetings would be a localized location around a SCRUM board for meetings where
    all team members can congregate around. Stand-up daily meetings would facilitate
    face-to-face communication, so that ideas and discussions are done
    thoroughly and can be recorded using the SCRUM board, ensuring  miscommunications are minimised.

### Product Backlog

-   As mentioned in the ‘Project Practice Guide’ for both the phases of this development, the use of the product backlog to
    record all requirements and changes in the form of user stories is an effective way of handling
    change. As sprints are completed, user stories can be evaluated or
    edited. These changes can be brought up in Sprint Planning Meetings at the beginning of each sprint with any product backlog items that have changed being remade or removed.

-   A reccomended tool for managing change of the Portfolio management softare using SCRUM is an online repository that would store the     backlog and have it updated in real-time. The use of a repository helps back-up any project documentation for the portfolio            management software as well as keep all documentation in a centralised, easily accessible place. This will allow the team to access     the backlog from their workstation, allowing any team member who has a change that was not described in the
    product backlog, to be able to note it down for the next meeting.
