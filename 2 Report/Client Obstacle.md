The Client’s Obstacle
=====================

The 2004 “Share Portfolio Management” software is unique in it’s market and is
currently used exclusively by 11 companies that belong to a single Investment
Management franchise. It is currently maintained and supported by a team of 3,
however because of it’s large body of code that has decayed over time, has
resulted in the system’s stability, usability and support of current platforms
to become an issue. Replacement software was searched for, but because of the
uniqueness of the current software, the client decided to have the current
software redeveloped and also have it extended for extra features. The
redevelopment would take place within an in-house development team consisting of
12 new members, which would then increase to about 18 by 2017. So the client has
asked us to recommend a suitable and effective approach for their development
team to use to most effectively redevelop and extend the current software.
