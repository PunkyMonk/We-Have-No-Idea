The Client’s Obstacle
=====================

The “Share Portfolio Management” software, developed in 2004, is unique in the market and is
currently used exclusively by 11 companies that belong to a single Investment
Management franchise.


It is currently maintained and supported by a team of 3. However because of it’s large body of code that has decayed over time, has resulted in the system’s stability, usability and support of current platforms to become an issue.

The stability of the current codebase will force the current system to often crash, due to not supporting current platforms. This explains why there is an issue with usability of the current system because there will be features and code of the current software that are unusable on current platforms. 

Replacement software was searched for, but because of the uniqueness of the
current software, the client decided to have the current software redeveloped
and also have it extended for extra features. 


The client has asked us to recommend a suitable and effective approach for
their development team to most effectively redevelop and extend their
current software. The redevelopment would take place
within an in-house development team consisting of 12 new members, which would
then increase to about 18 by 2017.
