The Client’s Obstacle
=====================

The “Share Portfolio Management” software, developed in 2004, is unique in the market and is
currently used exclusively by 11 companies that belong to a single Investment
Management franchise.

(isn't this almost word for word from the brief? - good though. this is the client's obstacles)
It is currently maintained and supported by a team of 3. 
However because of it’s large body of code that has decayed over time, has resulted in the system’s
stability, usability and support of current platforms to become an issue.

(maybe talk about stability issues from decayed codebase instead? This kind of doesn't make sense)
*Decayed code stunts a developer’s chance to change the base code, therefore
either a replacement or redeveloping the entire software would be beneficial.*

(paragraph about usability and support?)

(also from the brief. I don't think expansion of the development team is an 'obstacle')
Replacement software was searched for, but because of the uniqueness of the
current software, the client decided to have the current software redeveloped
and also have it extended for extra features. The redevelopment would take place
within an in-house development team consisting of 12 new members, which would
then increase to about 18 by 2017.

(seems too short.. I think we should state exactly what our solution is. - unless this is another section of the report)
So the client has asked us to recommend a suitable and effective approach for
their development team to use to most effectively redevelop and extend the
current software.
