Quality Assurance
        
Quality assurance is critical in maintaining high standard and integrity of work that conforms to the requirements collected. Functional standards are tested using peer reviews with procedural checks based on set criteria and black box testing checks for system validity ensuring bug free operation. Acceptance testing and usability testing are associated with validating software based on internal perspective, helping optimizing the code and locating potential hidden errors.
        
In addition to the general practices described in the guide the project team may need to set up:


 Version control
                Using project management software like github
        Confirm requirements
                Refer to user stories to check that the product fulfils the definition of done


The current version do not support mobile and as such user interface and functionalities may cause error when imported to a mobile device, to avoid this they need to plan various tests that checks for correct function.
