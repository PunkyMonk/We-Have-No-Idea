# Requirements Engineering Practices


The requirements engineering process is comprised of eliciting requirements from stakeholders, modelling and validating requirements (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 59). According to Hoffman, eliciting requirements is the most important and difficult process of a software project.

The following practices are recommended for successful requirements engineering from stakeholders by the Franchise group undergoing development of the Share portfolio management software.


# Verifying and validating requirements (not a practice but process)

This process involves using modelling methods such as prototyping using gathered requirements, peer reviewing and doing walkthroughs of scenarios to improve the specifications of the software (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65).

## Involve customers and users throughout the Requirements Engineering process

By involving customers and users throughout the requirements engineering process, a software project can be more successful. Customer and user involvement allows a "better understanding of the real needs" (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65) of a software project. Hoffman also states that the most important factor towards successful requirements engineering is user participation. 

## Identify and consult all stakeholders and potential sources of requirements

Identifying all stakeholders makes sure that all requirements are covered. By continually collaborating with stakeholders you can make sure that all requirements are collected and interpreted properly (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65). This also allows projects to verify and validate requirements that may have been misinterpreted from individual stakeholders (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 63).

## Assign skilled team members and project managers

Successful software projects have teams that are experts in knowledge of the respective application domain, IT, and requirements engineering ( Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65). Having the right ratio of these on a requirements engineering team will ensure that the best mix of knowledge, resources, and processes are used when engineering requirements (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65).

## Allocate the most resources towards the requirements engineering process

According to Hubert F. Hofmann in his paper, "Requirements Engineering as a Success Factor in Software Projects", projects that are more successful tent to have significantly more time and resources dedicated to requirements engineering than those that are not as successful. Hofmann states that between 15 to 30 percent of the total project effort should be spent on requirements engineering. The overall goal of this is that it allows a software project to develop a high quality specification of the software throughout its lifecycle (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65, table 2).

## Maintain a good relationship with all stakeholders

By maintainng strong healthy relationships with stakeholders allows a software project to be more successful. By continuously collaborating with stakeholders you can ensure that requirements are interpreted properly (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65). Continuous communication also allows a software project to deal with changing requirements and avoid communication breakdowns (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65). The biggest key benefit of maintaining a good relationship with all stakeholders is that it better satisfies the needs of the customers (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65, table 2).

## Prioritize requirements

Prioritzing requirements is important to successful requirements engineering because of project time and budget constraints (Young, R., 2002, pg. 9). In many projects there is not enough time to provide the stakeholders with everything they want. By prioritizing requirements, uneccessary features can be minimized which reduces costs and design constrants (Young, R., 2002, pg. 9).

## Develop models and prototypes using the requirements

According to Dr. Ralph Young in his paper, "Reccomended Requirements Gathering Practices", prototyping in a software project is technique of building rough and quickly implemented versions of a system. Developing prototypes are important to making a successful product as they show the capabilities of the system to users and designers (Young, R., 2002, pg. 11). It allows serves to help facilitate communication by team members to help them understand the requirements better (Youg, R., 2002, pg. 11).
According to Dr. Ralph Young also, "A Model is a representation of reality that is intended to facilitate understanding". Models are used in effective requirements engineering in order to help facilitate understanding of the requirements of a project.

The use of prototypes and models as a best practice help eliminate ambiguities and inconsistencies in a project's requirements (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65, table 2).

## Use a traceability matrix

A traceability matrix is a document that shows relations between two sets of values. In requirements engineering, a traceability matrix is used to track requirements' lifecycles from their conception through to their implementation (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 66). This is a best practice for requirements engineering, because it allows projects to document links between requirements and the products produced (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65).

## use peer reviews and team discussion

Peer reviews and team discussion in requirements engineering is the process of conferring with team members and product managers to verify and validate requirements. This helps improve the specifications of a project and create higher customer satisfaction (Hofmann, H., 2001, pg. 65, table 2).
