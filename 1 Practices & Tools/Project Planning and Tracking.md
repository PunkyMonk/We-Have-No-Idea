Project Planning and Tracking
-----------------------------

-   Artefacts should be used throughout development - Product Backlog, Sprint
    Backlog and a Burndown chart. The burndown chart will assist the team in
    tracking progress visually, and measuring overall throughput and velocity.
    This is especially important assuming the new system must replace the old
    system as soon as possible.

-   Individual SCRUM board artefacts to help each team track progress for the
    project, is an effective tool to use especially when there are two teams
    involved as it makes the project more transparent - which is the visibility
    to all stakeholders. (R. Salisbury, 2015)

-   SCRUM Story points should be used for effort estimation of backlog items.
