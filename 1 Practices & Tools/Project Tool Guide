*Online options: * - For distant stakeholders

Voice-talk communication (Skype)

Secure Online repository (Google Drive)

*Offline Options: * - For localized stakeholders

Meetings at a localized location.
 

Voice-talk Communication

Voice-talk communication software will be used for daily meetings that involve any stakeholders that are unable to attend stand-up meetings. For example overseas or distant stakeholders that cannot attend stand-up meetings on a daily basis. Online resources like Skype can be used effectively as a communication medium, as it provides webcams for face-to-face talks, and a written chat feature for stakeholders without Mics. (Yip, 2006)

 

Secure Online Repository

A secure online repository for storing, sharing and viewing updated backlogs in real-time can be used for stakeholders that are distant or for stakeholders that want a way to be constantly exposed to the backlogs whilst working. Online resources like Google Drive are secure for only stakeholders involved, and can be used with the Google Docs feature to update and view documents in real-time.

 

Meetings at a Localized location

For all stakeholders that are able to travel to a localized location on a daily basis for daily meetings will be much more beneficial for all parties involved than having online meetings. Stand-up meetings surpass the effectiveness of having online meetings, as information can be missed through online communication and having materials that cannot be shown effectively online can be demonstrated much more effectively. (Yip, 2006)
