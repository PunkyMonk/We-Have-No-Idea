### The project practice guide identifies and describes the recommended practices for each of the following areas: 

* Collaboration and Communication
* Requirements Engineering
* Project Planning and Tracking
* Managing Change
* Quality Assurance 


### Links are provided to resources that support the practice and that enable future teams to upskill

## Collaboration & Communication

Agile methodology emphasises the importance of adaptability due to the dynamic and competitive nature of the modern software development, and in such an environment it is crucial that teams and team members keep communicating throughout the duration of the project to successfully collaborate the divided workload.

For our case study there is a team of 3 members, with a potential to grow into 18, and it would benefit them to follow certain practices that have been proven to improve communication and collaboration.

According to research from Agile modeling (n.d.) the most effective communication is face- to- face that are enhanced by a medium like a white board. 

While communicating they should strive to utilise communication techniques that are applicable to their situation (e.g. if members are missing face to face conversation with notes may be more efficient), change your approach throughout the project to fit the situation.


Controlling the factors that may affect communication may also be a good practice. 
Physical proximity
When people are closer together they have a greater chance for communicating

Temporal proximity
Whether people are working at the same time can also interrupt the workflow

Amicability
People’s willingness to hear and accept that thoughts given by another person


A widely used practice for collaboration include “daily scrums” where each team member report their progress and plan what they will be working on until their scrum the next day. It improves information sharing as well as awareness of what other team members are working on, how their work may clash with yours, etc.
