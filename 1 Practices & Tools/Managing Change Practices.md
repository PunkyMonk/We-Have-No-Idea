Managing Change Practices
=========================

Managing Change within a software development team refers to approaches used by
the team to change the use of resources, possible requirements of the product or
any changes to the process of developing.

The approaches that could be used to help manage changes are Establishing a
solid governance body, defining a sprint, holding daily stand-up meetings,
having an end of sprint retrospective and constant communication within the
team, as stated by Span (2015).

**Establishing a governance body:**

As most changes arise in many different forms, they need to be efficiently dealt
with and easily tracked. Having a solid governing body will give individual
members of a team assigned roles according to their strengths in a particular
area at the start of the development process. This will force all changes
related to a role to be forwarded to the corresponding team member(s), whom will
deal with the change, and make any necessary changes. The change would be
recorded by the team member(s), so if the change needed to be tracked in the
future, a record will exist that will track who and what was changed.

**Holding retrospectives: ​**

In Scrum holding retrospectives regularly is a way for the development team to
reflect on what went well and what did not before moving ahead in a project.
During these retrospectives is a chance for the team to review changes that were
made, and decide on if the appropriate action was done, and what possible
effects it could have in the future that they can predict and somehow prevent.

**Communication:**

Daily/Frequent and effective communication among members of the team or with
stakeholders increases chances of successful change efforts. Through
communications team members are constantly alerted to upcoming or possible
changes. These changes would be addressed and dealt with by the team to keep all
members aware what is changing within the project. Also any changes to
requirements that stakeholders may have can also be communicated to the
development team, so that the finished product will meet the expectations of the
stakeholders.
