## Team Foundation server

Team foundation Server (TFS) is a Microsoft project management tool for managing software projects. TFS provides source code management to allow teams to manage small and large codebases and keep them well documented. TFS also has features for project management and resource allocation for agile and waterfall development teams. TFS is available in two forms: on-premises and online. This means that the software can be accessed and utilised from a companies intranet or online from any location.

We recommend that the Share portfolio management software development team use Team Foundation server as it provides features for Requirements engineering, Project planning and tracking, and Managing change. The source code management support is good for managing the large decaying codebase of the existing software. The project approach of using SCRUM methodologies for development is supporting by tfs including features for agile project management. Because the software is part of a franchise group, TFS can be used across multiple locations of the Investment management franchise's intranet or online without the need of a dedicated server.



## SCRUM board

A scrum board is a board that tracks work for an entire development process, by splitting work into three categories: To do, In Progress and Done. A scrum board traditionally consists of burndown charts and backlogs which contain each piece of work as cards. Each piece of work traditionally has the effort, priorities and the work that is required to be done. As work is completed or worked on, they move categories until all work that were in To Do has moved all to Done. If a team is located and work at the same location a physical scrum board is much more beneficial as the team will be constantly exposed to it, constantly reminding the team what is happening (Scrum Board - Scrum Inc, n.d).

We recommend that the Share portfolio management software development team use a SCRUM board as it is an essential part of the SCRUM process and subsidizes the reccomended planning and tracking practices for this project.

## Github

Github is a web-based code hosting service that uses Git for version control of source code and file management by allowing users to create repositories for individual software projects and documents. 

If a team is located at the same location as a physical repository where documents like product backlogs and sprint backlogs can be created on the scrum board, it is more beneficial to plan and track the project this way, because as like Scrum boards, being constantly exposed to it will constantly remind members if they are completing tasks as planned. However, in the cases where this cannot be acheived we recommend that the Share portfolio management software development team use Github as an option for source code control/planning and tracking of the project  as it allows support for the existing decaying codebase and version control of supplementary documents associated to the SCRUM development process. It can also store backlogs in the form of documents, and version control can be easily done.


## Skype for business

Voice-talk communication software will be used for daily meetings that involve any stakeholders that are unable to attend stand-up meetings. For example overseas or distant stakeholders that cannot attend stand-up meetings on a daily basis. Online resources like Skype can be used effectively as a communication medium, as it provides webcams for face-to-face talks, and a written chat feature for stakeholders without Mics. (Yip, 2006)
