## Team Foundation server

Team foundation Server (TFS) is a Microsoft project management tool for managing software projects. TFS provides source code management to allow teams to manage small and large codebases and keep them well documented. TFS also has features for project management and resource allocation for agile and waterfall development teams. TFS is available in two forms: on-premises and online. This means that the software can be accessed and utilised from a companies intranet or online from any location.

We recommend that the Share portfolio management software development team use Team Foundation server as it provides features for Requirements engineering, Project planning and tracking, and Managing change. The source code management support is good for managing the large decaying codebase of the existing software. The project approach of using SCRUM methodologies for development is supporting by tfs including features for agile project management. Because the software is part of a franchise group, TFS can be used across multiple locations of the Investment management franchise's intranet or online without the need of a dedicated server.
